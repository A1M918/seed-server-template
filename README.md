### Getting Started

The repo contains the typescript javascript project template!

### Standard Guidelines
- Create class with first UpperCamelCase like `ThisIsMyClass` .
- Class file's name will also be UpperCamelCase and should be same as the ClassName.
- Unit tests for every addition / subtraction should be written and make sure to cover all of the written code in tests.
- Test coverage should be above *70%*
- All the code that is using classes and is not a `class` should not be into `src` folder. It should be either into `scripts` folder or should be into a sub-folder with a relevant name.
- Force push to Remote repo is avoided. If needed please do it with approval of senior member of team.
- Write proper documentation of each method, class, or business logic wherever possible.
